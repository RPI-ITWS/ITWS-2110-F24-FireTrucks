10-17 Meeting

Today we discussed what progress we have made so far on the tasks we assigned ourselves.

Robert: Completed the backend for the login. The user can now create an account and log into it.
At the moment this has no effect on the rest of the website. Planning to use an API for email verification. For the future,
will work on this API as well as making the login look a little better.

Satyam: Continued to work on the profile page.

Tim: Finished the auction page backend, so it is functional now.

Mikah: Started working on the goods and services backends. We discussed how searching and filtering would work.

Shivani: Worked on the PHP for the listing form.
