10-27 Meeting

This meeting, we reviewed what we had accomplished from Sprint 2 up to the midterm presentations.
We were happy with the progress we made on the individual pages, but we thought we should have assigned more time
to connecting the pages, because often they conflicted with each other.

We kept working a little on our parts fixing the issues we encountered during the presentation.
