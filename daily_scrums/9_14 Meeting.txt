9_14 Meeting

We decided that we will prioritize frontend development and database setup first so that in future sprints,
everyone can work on functionality without requiring database or frontend first.

We were discussing implementing a chat feature for buyers and sellers to communicate. We heard about an API which we could use,
but after looking into it, we realized the work required is beyond the scope of the class.
